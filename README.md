plib
====

a reasonable slow and simple parser framework, the biggest advantage is that the lib is very flexible.(Don't beat me)

What to do next
---------------
A state machine like parser with man-made call stack to turn on super long recursion ability.

What the hell is it?
--------------------
May be continuation passing style? I don't know. I am not good at lisp and lisp-like javascript.Forgive me for my ignorance.

This is created for my self, but just take it if you like it.

This is not a library that its idea was brought from other parsers, I just made for some stupid and (maybe) online usage. The parser does not fit any standard if there is one, but it **does** make sure that computers can parse it easily.

And it can also be a sketch(of a new and huge language or a simple embedded CLI).
